<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr >

<h3>Super Mario Bros Movie</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite movies because of all the nostalgic references to 
    Nintendo videogames I've played as a kid, also because peach is so cute and 
    delicious xd
</p>

<h3>Your Name</h3>

<p>This is one of my favourite anime movies because of how beautiful it is, not 
    only speaking of the story but also the animation and drawings are beautiful
    and the story is one of the best love stories I've ever seen, really recommended.

<h3>Tetris</h3>
<p>This film is in my opinion one of the greatest videogame story adaptation because
    the real story is actually quite inspiring but also it is filled with suspense 
    and it teaches the audience how the world of videogames evolved.
